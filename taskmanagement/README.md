# Task Management

Task Management is a web application that organizes your tasks. It will allow you to add new tasks by entering the info at the bottom. If you want to edit existing tasks, press the edit button the task you want to edit then fill out the form at the bottom. After all the info has been added, press edit. You can also rearrange its importance by dragging the task up or down based on priority (important or not important). You could also finally press delete if the task is completed or no longer required to complete.

## Installation

To install this web application on your machine, you unzip the folder. In an existing MySQL database, create a database name. After you unziped the application, click on the .env file using your favorite IDE. In that file change the database name based on the database you created. Once you do that, in your favorite IDE, open the Task Management folder. Run PHP Artisan Migrate. If successful, you will see the necessary database tables created. Once you do that, then create two more tab on your terminal all in the main Task Management folder. In the first tab, run PHP artisan serve. In the second, run NPM Install then NPM run dev. Type 127.0.0.1 in a browser so you can see it successfully.

Once you see it on the screen, you will need to register as a new user. Once you register as a new user, you will see the dashboard with a form at the bottom. There you can enter tasks which should appear on the top.

## Other Options to view it

Instead of that, you could also type in the IP address 67.207.91.104 in your browser. I have setup a live demonstration for taskmanagement. You could also clone TaskManagement from GitHub then follow the same procedure as installation instruction.
